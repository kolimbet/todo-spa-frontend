The application requires authorization. You can register a new user or use a pre-installed profile (login: admin@mail.ru ; password: 123456) who has 100 tasks created by default. All forms in the application use validation with Vuelidate.

Pagination and filters are used to display the task list. The following actions are available with tasks: adding new ones, deleting, completing, changing the task description. Most of the actions in the application are performed by double-clicking.

The user's home page with three tabs is also available:

- Home with task counter (active | completed | total)
- User Avatar with the ability to install an avatar from the list of images uploaded by the user. Here you can also download new images and delete already downloaded ones
- Change password where you can change the current user password
